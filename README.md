In this project, we developed a command-line tool to perform various image processing operations:

1. ```Grayscale``` program : converts an RGB color image to grayscale. 
2. ```Invert``` program : inverts the colors of an RGB image.
3. ```Rotate``` program : rotates the image by 90°, 180°, or 270° (clockwise).
